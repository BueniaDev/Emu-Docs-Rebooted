At your request for documentation on the extra z80 instructions<br>
I've dug into my subdirectories and out came a file which is listed below.<br>
I hope it helps understanding the Z80, most instructions are a direct result of the way it is microcoded.<br>
That is also visible in an instruction like LD A,HL.<br>
There is the 3-byte fast function and the #ED prefix one, which is considerably slower but implemented anyway when the Great ChipMaker decided to expand the instructionset with LD A,BC; LD A,DE;<br>
The way these instructions are decoded implements automatically the LD A,HL instruction for the second time.<br>
Why Zilog is silent about the next bunch of instructions is a mystery to me.<br>
But they also make the Z800, the Z8000, the Z180, the Z280 and the Z380 which must al be compatible on instruction
level so maybe the extra z80 instructions aren't implemented in
one of these.<br>
Who cares anyway, lets get to the :)<br></p><p></p><pre>Undocumented Z80 instructions

----------------------------------------------

If an opcode works with the registers HL, H or L then if that
opcode is preceded by #DD (or #FD) it works on IX, IXH or IXL
(or IY, IYH, IYL), with some exceptions.
  The exeptions are instructions like LD H,IXH and LD L,IYH
because it isn't clear from the opcode on which register the
prefix (#FD or #DD) should operate, so from the opcodes point
of view we can read LD H,IXH but also LD IXH, H and obviously
LD IXH,IXH doesn't do us any good, does it?
  Instructions like LD IXH,IXL should work but I didn't test
them yet, my debugger went bananas and is now retired to the
afterlife for computerprograms...
  I also have doubts about the usefullness and correctness of
the OUT (C),F instruction.
  The IN (C), F instructions is only usefull if you test bits
which have the same number as a flag in the F-register because
some older Z80 lock up otherwise.
  An instruction which uses the #ED and the #DD (or #FD) prefix
is also invalid,
so IN IXH,(C) which should translate to DD ED .. is NOT valid.

Anyway, here's a list of valid, but undocumented by Zilog,
instructions...

These instructions are tested on: Z80A, Z80B and Z80H.

  #ED #71          OUT  F,(C)                               (?)

  All the above instructions also work with IY, IYH and IYL,
just replace #DD for #FD.

NOTES:
1) These instructions are strange because in fact they are
   two instructions in one.
   Lets examine the folowing line

   #DD #CB nn #00   RLC  (IX+nn)   &amp;  LD   B,(IX+nn)

   The value at address (IX+nn) is left rotated through the
   carry AND is loaded in the B register. I bet that some sophisticated
   programmers may make excellent use of these commands but I reccomend
   against using them because its task it not obvious from the opcode,
   and my assembler doesn't (YET) support them, I've got to find a nice
   short symbol for them, maybe something like RLC(IX+nn)-&gt;B.

2) These instructions are equivalent to the SLA command. That is
   perfectly logical:
   An arithmethic rightshift (SRA) has to preserve the 7-th (sign)bit, A
   logical rightshift (SRL) doesn't. The arithmetic leftshift doesn't
   preserve anything, in two's complement the 6-th bit becomes the sign.
   A logical leftshift hasn't got anything to do with signbits so it also
   doesn't preserve any bits. The difference is the way we look at the
   resulting number, a 8-bit byte or a 7-bit integer with 1 sign-bit.

          UNDOCUMENTED Z-80 OPCODES by Bill  Smythe  is  reprinted
          from the CHICATRUG NEWS (Chicago TRS-80  Users'  Group).
          NORTHERN  BYTES  editor's  note:   This  is   the   most
          comprehensive article that I have seen to date  covering
          this subject!

          If you are willing to set  aside  your  Editor/Assembler
          for a while and take a direct look at the Z-80  opcodes,
          certain patterns will become apparent.  For example,  of
          the 256 possible opcodes (00 through FF)  all  but  four
          are in use as  one-byte  instructions.   Some  of  these
          stand alone;  others are followed by  one-  or  two-byte
          operands.  For example:

                  13           INC DE           (no operand)
                  3E nn        LD A,nn          (1-byte operand)
                  10 dd        DJNZ dd          (1-byte operand)
                  01 nn mm     LD BC,mmnn       (2-byte operand)

          The four missing opcodes are CB, DD, ED, and FD.   These
          serve as  "escape  codes"  to  alert  the  Z-80  that  a
          two-byte instruction is coming up.  Examples:

               CB C0           SET 0,B
               DD 21 nn mm     LD IX,mmnn
               ED 80           LDIR
               FD 2B           DEC IY

          Like the one-byte instructions, some two-byters are used
          with operands, while others stand alone.

          One of the first observations made by any Z-80 hacker is
          the parallel among HL, IX, and IY instructions:

                  21 nn mm     LD HL,mmnn
               DD 21 nn mm     LD IX,mmnn
               FD 21 nn mm     LD IY,mmnn

                  77           LD (HL),A
               DD 77 jj        LD (IX+jj),A
               FD 77 jj        LD (IY+jj),A

          Almost any instruction referring to HL can be changed to
          the corresponding instruction for IX or IY by  prefixing
          DD or FD, respectively.  When HL appears in parentheses,
          it becomes  (IX+jj)  or  (IY+jj),  where  the  index  jj
          appears in the opcode as the second byte  following  the
          DD or FD.  Meanwhile,  the  two-byte  opcodes  beginning
          with CB form an  orderly  set  of  shift,  rotate,  set,
          reset, and bit-test instructions, while  the  relatively
          disorganized ED set performs a variety of useful tasks.

          And then there are the combined prefixes DDCB and  FDCB.
          Their relationship to the CB codes are pretty much  what
          you would expect:

                  CB 46        BIT 0,(HL)
               DD CB jj 46     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               FD CB jj 46     BIT 0,(IY+jj)

          <b>---------  T h e  F u n  B e g i n s -----------</b>
</h2>
          Everything said so far is pretty much common  knowledge,
          well-documented by Zilog, the  Z-80  manufacturer.   But
          what happens when DD or FD is prefixed to an instruction
          not containing HL?

                  37           SCF
                  C3 nn mm     JP mmnn

               DD 37           ?????
               FD C3 nn mm     ?????

          As far as I can determine, the prefixes in  these  cases
          have  no  effect.   The  two  instructions  shown   here
          continue to function as SCF and JP mmnn, respectively.

          But what if the instruction deals with either  H  or  L,
          but not HL?

                  24           INC H
                  2E nn        LD L,nn

          Just  as  the  register  pair  HL  is  made  up  of  two
          registers, H and  L,  it  appears  that  the  16-bit  IX
          register consists of two 8-bit registers, which I  shall
          call  HX  and  LX.   Similarly  for   IY.    The   above
          instructions become:

               DD 24           INC HX
               DD 2E nn        LD LX,nn
               FD 24           INC HY
               FD 2E nn        LD LY,nn

          The last instruction, for example, loads  the  low-order
          half of the IY register with the value nn while  leaving
          the high-order half untouched.

          If, however, an instruction contains both H and (HL), or
          both L and (HL), then only the (HL) part is affected  by
          the addition of DD or FD:

                  66           LD H,(HL)
               DD 66 jj        LD H,(IX+jj)
               FD 66 jj        LD H,(IY+jj)

          Adding a second DD or FD  in  front  has  no  additional
          effect.  Apparently, there are no such  instructions  as
          LD HX,(IX+jj) or LD HY,(IY+jj).

          <b>---------  W h a t ' s  Y o u r  C B  H a n d l e ? -----------</b>

          The CB instructions are divided into four groups:

               CB00 through CB3F:     rotate and shift group
               CB40 through CB7F:     BIT testing
               CB08 through CBBF:     RESet group
               CBC0 through CBFF:     SET group

          Of these four groups, all seem complete except  for  the
          first.  The first group is divided into eight  subgroups
          of eight instructions each:

               CB00-CB07:      RLC (rotate left circular)
               CB08-CB0F:      RRC (rotate right circular)
               CB10-CB17:      RL  (rotate left through carry)
               CB18-CB1F:      RR  (rotate right through carry)
               CB20-CB27:      SLA (shift left arithmetic)
               CB28-CB2F:      SRA (shift right arithmetic)
               CB30-CB37:      ???????
               CB38-CB3F:      SRL (shift right logical)

          The missing CB30 group looks as though it ought to be  a
          shift left logical, whatever that is.  Trouble  is,  SLA
          (shift left arithmetic) is already pretty  logical.   So
          what's left for SLL to do?  As might  be  expected,  SLL
          shifts bits 0 through 6 leftward into bits 1 through  7,
          while bit 7 goes into the carry flag.   But  then  comes
          the surprise -- bit 0 is set.  Yes, Virginia, regardless
          of the previous status of any bit, or of any flag, bit 0
          is turned on.  Thus SLL, in effect, multiplies by 2  and
          adds 1.  As with the other CB instructions, the affected
          register is B, C, D, E, H, L, (HL), or  A  depending  on
          which instruction, CB30 through CB37, is used.

          Of the combined opcodes,  DDCBjjxx  and  FDCBjjxx,  only
          every eighth one is documented by Zilog:

               DD CB jj 06     RLC (IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 0E     RRC (IX+jj)
                    (etc.)

          One might not expect much from those not  on  the  list,
          since the corresponding  DD-less  CB  instructions  have
          nothing to do with HL.  Not so,  however  --  a  lot  of
          weird stuff is going on here:

               DD CB jj 00     RLC B,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 01     RLC C,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 02     RLC D,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 03     RLC E,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 04     RLC H,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 05     RLC L,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 06     <documented, as="" above="">
               DD CB jj 07     RLC A,(IX+jj)

          -- and similarly for RRC, RL, RR,  SLA,  SRA,  SLL,  and
          SRL.  But what does that mean, "RLC B,(IX+jj)"?   THat's
          just a name I chose for a peculiar phenomenon  in  which
          (IX+jj) is rotated left cirular, then copied into B.  In
          other words, RLC B,(IX+jj) is like RLC (IX+jj)  followed
          by LD B,(IX+jj).

          The SET and RESet instructions are even more curious:

               DD CB jj 80     RES B,0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 81     RES C,0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 82     RES D,0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 83     RES E,0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 84     RES H,0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 85     RES L,0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 86     <documented: res="" 0,(ix+jj)="">
               DD CB jj 87     RES A,0,(IX+jj)

          I don't know how many Editor/Assemblers could  handle  3
          operands, even if they recognized undocumented  opcodes.
          I couldn't think  of  any  other  way  to  express  what
          happens -- (IX+jj) first has bit 0 reset, then is copied
          into the indicated register (e.g.  B).   The  action  is
          equivalent to RES 0,(IX+jj) followed  by  LD  B,(IX+jj).
          Of course, the same can be done with bits 1  through  7,
          with SET as well as RESet, and with IY as well as IX.

          The BIT instructions are less interesting.  Undocumented
          codes  DDCBjj40  through  DDCBjj47  turn   out   to   be
          equivalent to the documented version.  No  copying  into
          registers B, C, D, etc.  is done:

               DD CB jj 40     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 41     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 42     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 43     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 44     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 45     BIT 0,(IX+jj)
               DD CB jj 46     BIT 0,(IX+jj)  <documented>
               DD CB jj 47     BIT 0,(IX+jj)

          My investigations into the ED group  yielded  little  of
          interest.  There were some duplications;   for  example,
          the eight instructions ED44,  ED4C,  ED54,  ED5C,  ED64,
          ED6C, ED74, ED7C all turned out to be NEG,  even  though
          only the first is documented  as  such.   I  also  found
          duplicates for RETN, RETI, IM 0, IM 1, and IM 2.   There
          were also a couple of "expected" duplicates:

               ED 63 nn mm     LD (mmnn),HL
               ED 6B nn mm     LD HL,(mmnn)

          -- but these instructions  already  exist,  and  execute
          faster, in the non-ED set.

          The ED group did provide a couple of lone curiosities:

               ED 70           IN --,(C)
               ED 71           OUT (C),--

          These appear where you would  expect  the  "missing"  IN
          (HL),(C) and OUT (C),(HL).  Nothing happens  with  (HL),
          though.  IN --,(C) appears to function like IN A,(C), IN
          B,(C),  etc.,  except  that  the  result  does  not   go
          anywhere.  The flags, however, are set as expected.  OUT
          (C),-- seems to output a zero to the port.

          I could not detect any action for the first  and  fourth
          quarters  of  the  ED  set,  ED00-ED3F  and   EDC0=EDFF.
          Three-fourths of the third quarter is also "missing", as
          are two instructions in the  second  quarter,  ED77  and
          ED7F.  This leaves room for  178  more  instructions  --
          anyone for an upgrade?  I'd  like  to  see  instructions
          like LD B,(DE) and CP (DE) and SUB (DE).

          I said that any HL instruction could be changed to IX or
          IY by simply prefixing DD or  FD.   That  was  a  little
          white  lie.   The   following   instructions   are   not
          convertible because they begin with ED:

               ED 42           SBC HL,BC
               ED 4A           ADC HL,BC
               ED 52           SBC HL,DE
               ED 5A           ADC HL,DE
               ED 62           SBC HL,HL
               ED 6A           ADC HL,HL
               ED 72           SBC HL,SP
               ED 7A           ADC HL,SP
               ED 67           RRD  <rotate right="" decimal="" (hl)="">
               ED 6F           RLD  <rotate left="" decimal="" (hl)="">

          In  addition,  the  following  instructions  cannot   be
          converted even though they are one-byters:

                  D9           EXX  <exchange all="" registers="">
                  EB           EX DE,HL

          -- and the JP (HL) instruction becomes  JP  (IX)  or  JP
          (IY), not JP (IX+jj) or JP (IY+jj):

                  E9           JP (HL)
               DD E9           JP (IX)
               FD E9           JP (IY)

          Except for  DDCB  and  FDCB,  there  is  no  benefit  in
          combining two or more of the four escape  codes.   There
          are three cases:

            (1) In the event of multiple DDs and/or FDs, all but
            the last will be ignored.

            (2) EDCB, EDDD,  EDED,  and  EDFD  will  be  ignored
            entirely since they lie in  the  inoperative  fourth
            quarter of the ED set.

            (3) If either DD or FD precedes ED, the former  will
            be ignored.

          To any machine-language programmers whose appetites  may
          have been whetted:  Most Z-80 Editor/Assemblers  do  not
          recognize undocumented opcodes, so you'll have to  enter
          these codes as DEFBs.  More important, it is conceivable
          that not all Z-80s will respond to these  codes  in  the
          same way.  If you plan to sell your programs,  the  best
          advice is not to use undocumented instructions.
