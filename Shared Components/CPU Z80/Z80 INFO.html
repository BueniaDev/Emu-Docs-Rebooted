This section is based on the text contributed by Gerton Lunter, author
of "Z80" Spectrum emulator. I allowed myself to make some changes which
don't change the content.

<h1>Features on Z80 CPU</h1>

 Most Z80 opcodes are one byte long, not counting a possible byte or
word operand.  The four opcodes CB, DD, ED and FD are shift opcodes: they
change the meaning of the opcode following them.

<h2>a) CB opcodes:</h2>
   There are 248 different CB opcodes. The block CB 30 to CB 37 is missing
from the official list. These instructions, usually denoted by the mnemonic
SLL, Shift Left Logical, shift left the operand and make bit 0 always one.
These instructions are quite commonly used. For example, Bounder and Enduro
Racer use them.


<h2>b) DD and FD opcodes:</h2>
   The DD and FD opcodes precede instructions using the IX and IY registers.
If you look at the instructions carefully, you see how they work:


<pre>        2A nn           LD HL,(nn)
        DD 2A nn        LD IX,(nn)
        7E              LD A,(HL)
        DD 7E d         LD A,(IX+d)
</pre>



A DD opcode simply changes the meaning of HL in the next instruction. If a
memory byte is addressed indirectly via HL, as in the second example, a
displacement byte is added. Otherwise the instruction simply acts on IX
instead of HL (A notational awkwardness, that will only bother assembler
and disassembler writers: JP (HL) is not indirect; it should have been
denoted by JP HL). If a DD opcode precedes an instruction that doesn't use
the HL register pair at all, the instruction is executed as usual. However,
if the instruction uses the H or L register, it will now use the high or
low halves of the IX register! Example:

<pre>        44              LD B,H
        FD 44           LD B,IYh


</pre>



These types of inofficial instructions are used in very many programs. By the
way, many DD or FD opcodes after each other will effectively be NOPs, doing
nothing except repeatedly setting the flag "treat HL as IX" (or IY) and taking
up 4 T states (But try to let MONS disassemble such a block.).




<h2>c) ED opcodes:</h2>

   There are a number of inofficial ED instructions, but none of them are very useful.
The ED opcodes in the range 00-3F and 80-FF (except for the block instructions of course) do nothing at all but taking up 8 T states and
incrementing the R register by 2.  Most of the unlisted opcodes in the range 40-7F do have an effect, however. <br>
The complete list: (* = not official)

The ED70 instruction reads from port (C), just like the other instructions,
but throws away the result. It does change the flags in the same way as the
other IN instructions, however. The ED71 instruction OUTs a byte zero to port
(C), interestingly.  These instructions "should", by regularity of the
instruction set, use (HL) as operand, but since from the processor's point of
view accessing memory or accessing I/O devices is almost the same thing, and
since the Z80 cannot access memory twice in one instruction (disregarding
instruction fetch of course) it can't fetch or store the data byte (A hint in
this direction is that, even though the NOP-synonyms LD B,B, LD C,C etcetera
do exist, LD (HL),(HL) is absent and replaced by the HALT instruction.).
The IM 0/1 instruction puts the processor in either IM 0 or 1, I couldn't
figure out which on my own Spectrum.


<h2>d) About the R register:</h2>
   This is not really an undocumented feature, although I have never seen any
thorough description of it anywhere. The R register is a counter that is
updated every instruction, where DD, FD, ED and CB are to be regarded as
separate instructions. So shifted instruction will increase R by two. There's
an interesting exception: doubly-shifted opcodes, the DDCB and FDCB ones,
increase R by two too. LDI increases R by two, LDIR increases it by 2 times
BC, as does LDDR etcetera.  The sequence LD R,A/LD A,R increases A by two,
except for the highest bit: this bit of the R register is never changed. This
is because in the old days everyone used 16 Kbit chips. Inside the chip the
bits where grouped in a 128x128 matrix, needing a 7 bit refresh cycle.
Therefore ZiLOG decided to count only the lowest 7 bits. You can easily check
that the R register is really crucial to memory refresh. Assemble this program:


<pre>        ORG 32768
        DI
        LD B,0
    L1: XOR A
        LD R,A
        DEC HL
        LD A,H
        OR L
        JR NZ,L1
        DJNZ L1
        EI
        RET
</pre>





It will take about three minutes to run.  Look at the upper 32K of memory,
for instance the UDG graphics.  It will have faded.  Only the first few bytes
of each 256 byte block will still contain zeros, because they were refreshed
during the execution of the loop. The ULA took care of the refreshing of the
lower 16K (This example won't work on the emulator, of course!).


<h2>e) Undocumented flags:</h2>
   This undocumented "feature" of Z80 has its effect on programs like Sabre
Wulf, Ghosts'n Goblins and Speedlock. Bits 3 and 5 of the F register are not
used. They can contain information, as you can readily figure out by PUSHing
AF onto the stack and then POPping some it into another pair of registers.
Furthermore, sometimes their values change. I found the following empirical
rule:




<ul>
    The values of bits 7, 5 and 3 follow the values of the corresponding
    bits of the last 8 bit result of an instruction that changed the usual
    flags.


</ul>




For instance, after an ADD A,B those bits will be identical to the bits of
the A register (Bit 7 of F is the sign flag, and fits the rule exactly). An
exception is the CP x instruction (x=register, (HL) or direct argument). In
this case the bits are copied from the argument.
If the instruction is one that operates on a 16 bit word, the 8 bits of the
rule are the highest 8 bits of the 16 bit result - that was to be expected
since the S flag is extracted from bit 15.
Ghosts'n Goblins use the undocumented flag due to a programming error. The
rhino in Sabre Wulf walks backward or keeps running in little circles in a
corner, if the (in this case undocumented) behaviour of the sign flag in the
BIT instruction isn't right. I quote:

<pre>        AD86    DD CB 06 7E        BIT 7,(IX+6)
        AD8A    F2 8F AD           JP P,#AD8F
</pre>


An amazing piece of code!  Speedlock does so many weird things that all must
be exactly right for it to run. Finally, the '128 ROM uses the AF register to
hold the return address of a subroutine for a while.

<h2>f) Interrupt flip-flops IFF1 and IFF2:</h2>
   There seems to be a little confusion about these. These flip flops are
simultaneously set or reset by the EI and DI instructions. IFF1 determines
whether interrupts are allowed, but its value cannot be read. The value of
IFF2 is copied to the P/V flag by LD A,I and LD A,R. When an NMI occurs, IFF1
is reset, thereby disallowing further [maskable] interrupts, but IFF2 is left
unchanged. This enables the NMI service routine to check whether the
interrupted program had enabled or disabled maskable interrupts. So, Spectrum
snapshot software can only read IFF2, but most emulators will emulate both,
and then the one that matters most is IFF1.
