For anybody who wants to have some fun editing the images in their games,
exporting their favorite characters to separate pictures, or just learn
about Nintendo graphics, this doc will explain how they are stored. It
expects that you at least already know what bits, bytes, and pixels are.

1. -- Tiles Intro --------

If you have already read through some other docs about how sprites are
stored in the console itself, you will likely be a little familiar with
this; however, this doc explains how they are stored in the ROM
cartridge, not in the console's Video RAM during gameplay. Most of the
time, sprites are stored exactly the same in ROM as they would be in VRAM
for simplicity, but sometimes to save space, they can be arranged quite
differently in various compressed formats. Theoretically, they could be
stored in any way as long as they were eventually translated into the
standard 1, 2 or 4 bit tiles the two PPU's (Picture Processing Units)
understand. To view or edit these tiles in the ROM though, we need to
know how they are arranged in their compressed formats too.

For those that have not already read the documents by Yoshi or Dax about
the sprite formats, here is a little intro. Unlike computer game images
which are composed of hundreds of individual pixels, each one drawn by
the software itself, console systems (including the NES, Sega, GameBoy, &
SNES) build up all their scenes from larger blocks called tiles, which
are all automatically handled by dedicated graphics chips. For the all
the Nintendo consoles at least, each tile is always 8x8 pixels. Although
the number of colors can be variable, the dimensions are always the same.
Larger blocks like 16x16 are actually composed of smaller 8x8 tiles, four
to be exact. 32x32 sprites would be made of sixteen tiles. Why does the
SNES draw everything with these building blocks instead of little pixels?
For one it's just simpler, and for another reason, it saves a lot of
space. Instead of having two copies of the actual 256 pixels for two
16x16 blocks on screen, you only need one copy of the tile and then two
tile numbers to specify which ones to use. There are also of course some
disadvantages, like not being able to plot single pixels with as great of
ease, but apparently the benefits outweigh the downsides.

Instead of storing the full pixel color values, only the few colors used
in a sprite are stored. The color compressed scheme cuts the size
requirements in half for most sprites and allows for easy palette
rotation effects. Each pixel 'color' is actually an index into that
sprites palette of used colors, which then translates to a true RGB
value. The average character does not even use more than 10 colors, so
why store a full 8bit, 256 color value? To store the normal 16 colors for
a sprite, 4 bits are needed per pixel. For 8 colors, only 3 bits per
pixel; and for monochrome (two color) images, it only takes a single bit
to represent one pixel.

If you have ever noticed the same enemies with just different colors, or
on many games that bright white flash when you attack an enemy, it is
achieved very simply by just changing the palette for that sprite.
Another advantage of color compression is the game does not need to
change the value of every single color in the tile, only the associated
RGB values to those color indexes. Bty, just for correctness, the color
values are actually stored in the palette as BGR with red as the lowest
five bits instead of blue (Japanese designers decided to reverse the
standard order for some reason??). That does not change anything though.


2. -- Bitplanes ----------

Except for mode 7 which is different from everything else, each tile is
arranged from right to left (reverse order), top to bottom. Each byte
represents one row of eight pixel bits (not complete pixels). The number
of bytes needed for a single complete row depends on the color depth, or
actually the number of bits needed to represent that many colors. 1 bit
tiles would need 1 byte (8 bits) for a single monochrome row; 4 bit tiles
would need four bytes (32 bits). Unlike most PC graphics formats though,
instead of all the bits of each pixel being stored next to each other in
the same byte, they are stored with parallel bits of other pixels in the
same row. The the first bits of a complete eight pixel row are stored in
the first byte; all eight of the second bits are stored in the second
byte, third bits in the third byte, and so on it goes for as many bits as
it takes to express the necessary colors needed for that tile (from 2
colors to 256). All of the parallel bits of an entire tile is called a
bitplane (bpl). Note that screen planes and bitplanes are totally
different things. To make a whole pixel, all the split bits of a single
pixel are ORed until the desired bit depth is achieved.

                  3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ------- bitplane 3
                  3 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ----- bitplane 2
                  3 2 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 --- bitplane 1
                  3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 - bitplane 0
                  3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                  3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   Notice how the bitplanes
                  3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0   are always zero based.
                  3 2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                    2 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                      1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
                        0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0

For example, if a complete row of 4bit (16 color) pixels had a sequence
of 4,0,2,7,6,10,15,0 it would be stored like this:

  As pixels:       Then rearranged into bitplanes:

          0123          01234567
     зддддеее╢        здеееееее╢
  0 де 4  0100     0 де 00000110  byte 0
  1 де 0  0000     1 де 10011010  byte 1
  2 де 2  0010     2 де 00111110  byte 2
  3 де 7  0111     3 да 00010010  byte 3
  4 де 6  0110
  5 де 10 1010
  6 де 15 1111
  7 да 0  0000

Notice how the vertical column (parallel bits) become the horizontal rows
of each bitplane, and how adding another byte to the bitplanes would
essentially add an extra bit to each of the eight pixels (to make 32
colors). If the tile above was part of a background which need to first
be upped to 8bpl tiles, four extra bytes could simply be added to the
first four to make 8. Do you see how much easier for games to convert one
bitmode to another if it does not need to do a lot of bit shifting and
only mess with whole bytes. Many times, SNES sprites will only need 8
colors and be stored with 3 bits, but since the PPU only supports native
4bit sprites, they need to have an extra empty bitplane added to them.
Simply adding an extra byte to every three sure beats a lot of tedious
shifting and oring. Bty, since SNES sprites (independant moving objects)
can only be 16 colors, all other bitsize tiles are blit directly to the
VRAM as static images.

Remember that for any sprite, each pixel value is an index into its 16
color palette page. The 6 means to plot the absolute color value at index
6 in the current palette page - that RGB value could actually be
anything. I heard that there are 16 palettes of 16 colors each in the
total 256 color main palette, but only 8 of those can be used by sprites?
It seems like a severe limitation, but somehow those palette masters make
the most out of it and manage to make the games look like they have more
colors than they really do.

Unfortunately the example I gave above is actually more perfect than the
tiles really are. The bitplanes are not all nice and neat, with one
coming directly after the previous one. Some are by themselves, while
others are interleaved with each other. This extra convolution really
does not help us in finding graphics, but it is easy enough to compensate
for.


3. -- All known formats listed --

There are six common modes used by SNES games to store graphics. Four are
color compressed modes that use 1-4 bits to express a single pixel value.
The other two are both 8bit modes that use all 256 colors (meaning no
palette pages). One of them is the famous mode 7 we were all so impressed
by in 1991 (and it's still cool). The GameBoy uses the exact same 1 & 2
bit formats that the SNES uses, except that instead of pixels translating
to colors, they only translate to shades of grey. There are also two
formats (1bit,2bit) used by just a few games that have 8x12 tile sizes.

Three of the familiar formats (1,2,4) I learned from various docs. The
other three (3,7,8) I figured out myself with some trial and error. Modes
3 & 7 nobody knew about and no docs previously existed on them - that's
partly why I wrote this. The only doc on 8bpl wasn't even right.

Each mode has a few positions in games where you can find an image in
that mode. They are all fairly common games, with the positions given as
you would find them in SMCs with the 512 byte header (for a pure ROM
without a header, subtract those first 512 bytes). Since the first byte
is always one when working with file records in Qbasic, all of the
positions are one-based (instead of zero-based).

Along with the format info, there is also a little sample letter 'A' for
each mode.

Bty, you can easily figure a tile's size the formula (h x w) * bits \ 8.
In the case of normal size tiles, the eights cancel and you only need use
8 * bits.

  This is of course the simplest one, with just 1 bitplane, each row
coming right after the previous one. It was learned from the Yoshi doc.

  Gameboy uses this mode for its sprites, with 4 shades of grey. The SNES
usually does not use it for sprites, but more commonly text and things
that needs more than just 2 colors. It is similar to 1bpl in that the
rows comes sequentially, except that it is made of two interleaved 1bpl
bitplanes. This one was explained in the Pan doc, and the VileWrath
source code.

  When sprites need more than 4 but not quite 16 colors, this is usually
the format they choose. It is not a native format of the SNES though, so
games must translate them into 4bit sprites first. The GameBoy does not
support this mode since the GB PPU only displays 4 shades of grey. The
first 2 bitplanes (0,1) are interleaved like 2bpl and the third (2) is a
single 1bpl that comes at the end of them. Why didn't anybody else find
out about this one before me, since it is used in so many games? Well
technically, the SNES programmers 'discovered' it long before I even knew
about emulation (it was simply 'rediscovered' :-). So far, I only told
one person about this precious mode and only his viewer supports it
(Magnus Runesson's SMC-Ripper). That may change though as soon everybody
else gets a fair chance at it and this doc is released publicly.

16 colors, 32 bytes: The native format of SNES sprites

  This is the actual native format used by the SNES for sprites. Often
times games will store them in this format because the sprites require
nearly all 16 colors, it is just easier, or they are not concerned about
storage space and do not want to be bother with conversion. For example,
while most images in Zelda are compressed (annoyingly) because of the
small ROM size, the ones in Super Metroid can afford to be expanded. That
game have so much space (3MB), it can even afford to waste some space.
4Bpl is like two 2bpl tiles together, with the first 2 bitplanes (0,1) in
the first 2bpl tile and the last 2 bitplanes (3,4) in the second 2bpl
tile. The Corsair doc is surprisingly the only accurate one I've seen on
this so common mode.

  When there needs to be a colorful picture like an opening screen or
part of a story, this is the one to use since it makes use of all 256
colors. It can not be used for sprites, so any parts of the picture that
need to move or be animated (usually they don't move though) must be
changed manually by the game code. It is just four 2bpl tiles, one after
another (or you can think of it as two 4bpl tiles). The first two
bitplanes (0,1) are followed by the next two (2,3), then the fixth and
sixth (4,5), and lastly the seventh and eighth (6,7). Only two viewers
support it. Despite the fact that no documents explained this mode, it
was easy enough to figure out.

-- 1bit bitplane 8x12 --
2colors, 12 bytes: Used in just a few games to save a little space

No examples (have not found any yet)

  This mode is very rare, but since this doc aims to cover all formats,
it is in here with all the others. It is used whereever tiles need to be
taller than 8 pixels but not quite 16. In the ROM, it saves about 25%
more space than it otherwise. Of course, a height of 12 is not a natively
supported tile height, so before using them in VRAM, the game must
convert them into two 8x8 tiles - with the first eight rows in the first
8x8 tile, the last four rows in the second tile, and four blank rows to
complete the second tile. The format is exactly like 1bpl 8x8s except
with 12 rows. I have not yet seen any tiles in this mode, but they are
explained in the doc by David Timko. So far, no major viewer specifically
supports it, although is is possible to still edit these tiles using the
more common 1bpl mode.

  A variation of previous mode that just uses two 1bit 8x12s to make a
single 2bit tile. This mode is also used where tiles need to be taller
than 8 but less than 16 pixels, and saves about 25% more space than two
8x8 tiles would. This has not been personally verified yet, so the format
written below might not be right. Again, I got it from the informative
doc by David Timko.

Zelda: 803329-ScalableMapPieces
So far Zelda is the only game I have really looked for Mode 7 graphics
in. A game like ActRaiser probably has lots of map pieces in it. Mario
Kart might also be a good source.

  This mode is very different from all the others. Instead of messing
with bitplanes and palettes, all bytes represent a single pixel that
corresponds to a color in the main palette. The difference between this
format and 8bpl, is that this mode can be used (with the help of some
great hardware) in awesome scaling, parallaxing, and rotation. The image
data is stored almost exactly the same as in VRAM, except in VRAM each
pixel is byte interleaved with other data. In the ROM, the bytes are
contiguous. I feel silly for not getting it right for so long, since it
is so simple. So far, at the time this document was written, no major
viewer supports it. Because it does not use bitplanes, it is a lot
simpler to view, edit, and explain!

Sailor Moon: 137139
Metroid 3: 829985,1868289 (this spot is bugging me)

  This space is for the future modes not figured out yet, many of them in
Japanese ROMs. How do I know there are undiscovered modes remaining? When
looking through certain games, all of the graphics simply are not
accounted for. They must be in there somewhere though, stored somehow.
Then there are those areas that just have to be to graphics, but are just
slightly messed up somehow (like 3pl used to be). According to Pan, there
may be another format of storing 2bit tiles where they composed of two
1bpl tiles, but that has not been verified anywhere. Although these are
all the common modes, I'm always on the lookout for new ones while
browsing through ROMs. If you have any not yet listed please do tell.
This list won't be complete until we have every single format used by
every game.


4. -- What viewers support them --

  The most common modes (1,2,4) are supported by any self-respecting
editor. The other three (3,7,8) have apparently never been figured out
before or something, because in the past six years that info on the SNES
has been around on the net, editors have only had those first three modes
(except X-char which had 8bit :-). Mode 7 is still not supported by any
viewer (except in a little BASIC program I wrote for the sole purpose of
discovering these modes). The last two 8x12 modes are irregular, but
could easily be supported by viewers if somebody would only make it.

  Viewer:     Author:          Modes:

  Nagav       L. Bontes        1 2   4      Fastest
  X-char      Planet X         1 2   4   8  Confusing
  Visor       Lord Esnes       1 2   4      Slow
  SMC-Ripper  Magnus Runesson  1 2 3 4   8  Great GUI and easy editing
  SpriteView  FDwR             1 2 3 4 7 8  Good tile finding features

  All of these viewers are available on the net. There may
be some others I've simply not come across. There is no editing in
SpriteView, just viewing, since it's purpose is to discover new
graphics modes. If you want to edit tiles, try one of the other viewers.


5. -- Problems finding sprites --

Programmers use a variety of techniques to save space (they only have a
max of four megabytes to cram all of their into) and since graphics
usually use the most of that space, they will come up with all kinds of
clever ways to fit more in less, most of which I never thought of before.
Sadly these 'wonderful' compression techniques can also make it hard for
us to find/edit the images, so some of them are explained below.

-- Symmtetrical Reduction --
Any symmetrical object is the same on one side as it is on the other, so
why not just store the left side (or the right side) and flip a copy of
it to make the other side of it? This also works with objects vertically
symmetrical. Some objects can even have radially symmetry, and need to
flipped four directions for complete repiecing. So do not bother looking
for the other side is when an object seems to be cut in half, or just a
quarter. When you edit one side, you also affect other(s). Try Mario
Allstars at 1696783 with a wrap width of 1 for an example of half tiles.

-- Tile crowding --
This technique makes use out of empty space, duplicate tiles, or tiles of
a single solid color by storing other tiles in there. That means you can
actually find pieces of one sprite inside another. There is nothing you
can do about it, just remember that is why the tiles look so scrambled.
You can see a little bit of this in AllStars at 1663503.

-- Row stripping --
Similar to tile crowding, instead of storing the entire rectangular
picture of an irregularly shaped image, only the signifigant sections are
stored. Most of the time, images are kept as a whole in their rectangluar
frame for simplicity, but when they become too large, the blank space on
either side of the object really adds up, so it is simply not stored. If
an object is wide at the top, strips long enough to hold that entire tile
row are stored. Then as the object becomes skinnier towards the base, the
length of the strips becomes shorter and closer together. You can see a
lot of this in DKC (take a look at 289483), and it is really annoying. To
see the images as they are supposed to look, you just need to change the
wrap width until the strips align (oddly none of the existing viewers
supported this).

-- Color compression --
Color compression was already explained above, but I just wanted to
mention again that because what is stored (except in 8bit modes) is
actually color indexes rather than RGB values, so the colors will look
all wrong when viewing images. It really helps to load the right palette
and see them in their true colors. Most of the time, it makes finding
images easier. You can get the color palette to any image in the ROM by
simply playing the game and exporting a snapshot of it to a PCX file
(GIFs are no good because they rearrange the palette colors). Games do
dynamically change their palette though as the player moves from title
screen to map screen, underwater level to desert level, so be sure to
grab a snapshot from the scene that the desired image is a part of. As of
the time this doc was written, no other viewer can load snapshot
palettes, but SMC-Ripper will soon!

-- Bitplanes out of phase --
This is not a compression technique, but it is commonly a problem. When
the base byte position is not aligned to the first bitplane of row 0, the
bitplanes will be out of phase. That means the wrong bitplane will be in
front and because the tile starts at the wrong place in the pattern, all
of the images will look funky - sprites with inverse coloring, part of
one sprite mixed up with another. You might be able to see the generic
outline of the object there, but something about it is not quite right.
To fix this, just adjust the base byte position until it looks right
(meaning the bitplanes are in phase and the pattern starts out on the
right row). For most viewers, the '+' and '-' keys are used for this
purpose.

Sometimes you will encounter some data that looks like graphics, but is
really just something else. You might simply be looking at it in the
wrong mode, or the bitplanes could be out of phase, but there are also
other repetitive data structures stored in ROMs that could be fooling
you. The most common thing to look like graphics is level grids. Then
again, who knows, maybe you are actually looking at a new mode and just
don't know it.


6. -- Thanks, credits, and sources --

That should have explain enough about graphics and tile formats to
satisfy the most curious of you, and even tell enough to make your own
viewer if you want. If you want to write a viewer yourself and have any
questions, or have modes not already in here, please mail me a letter.
Please send other questions though like how the SNES works, how to use
any of the above listed sprite editors, or anything else to the right
people. :-)

Why in the world did I just sit down and write this long doc? Because I
love the SNES and its games, and want to add my favorite characters to my
own games or have fun messing with them in their own game. This was
written for anybody else out there that might want to do the same. This
version should do it for a while, but as soon as any more modes are
discovered, I'll be sure to add them to a later one. ;-)


Here are some people that without knowing it helped with this doc:
  Yoshi for his informative docs about everything on the SNES
  Dax for the helpful, but innacurate info on screen formats
  Corsair+Kari for the SNES 4bpl mode
  Pan/Anthrox for the GameBoy information
  VileWrath for writing the easy to understand BASIC source code
    I did not actually understand bitplanes until then
  Savoury Snax for explaining how one bitmode is converted to another
  David Timko for his doc about 8x12 tiles
  Magnus Runesson for making his SMC-Ripper
  Everybody else who made a tile viewer and wrote a doc too
  All of you who care to read (and hopefully add to) this
